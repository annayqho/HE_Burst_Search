Hi Anna,

Attached are a few files that should be useful. 
GBM is offline about ~15% of the time when it is transiting the South Atlantic 
Anomaly. When it is online it is in a good time interval. 
Once you know if that GBM was active at a given time you can check if it was
observing a given position by calculating the angular offset from the source 
position to the center of the Earth, 
and anything ~<67 degrees was occulted 
(between ~66.5 and 67.5 its a bit uncertain, 
since the Earth isn't a perfect sphere). 

clock.py converts btwn standard time formats and the MET clock that Fermi uses
GBMgeo.py: calculations for angular offsets, finds Earth center at a given time
example.py: basic script showing how to call the necessary functions.

The GBM team is working on making a python suite for people to use to do 
analysis with GBM but this is unfortunately still some time out.

Let me know if you have any questions,
-Eric
