- understand what David Palmer's tool does
- get the BAT tool to work so that you can give it an RA and Dec and time
and it returns some kind of sensitivity (upper limit) or tells you that the
detector wasn't looking in that direction at all
- understand what the GBM tool does, 
get it to work for a certain GRB...say iPTF14yb
